We develop the site on the branch gh-pages. 
The url for the site will be: <username>.github.io/nargar (project name).

To get it running I had to install ruby with brew (to /usr).

Had to run gem install --user-install ffi -- --enable-libffi-alloc as per https://github.com/ffi/ffi/issues/864

bundle exec jekyll serve
